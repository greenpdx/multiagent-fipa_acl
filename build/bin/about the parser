possible modifications needed in the parser(using .h file as refference):


when we follow a binaryExpression production that ends up in a string literal:
	- the format is 0x14 string literal 0x00: the padding 0x00 is not currently added
	
	- the way I saw it implemented, the 0x00 byte can be deleted from the byteLengthEncodedStringTerminated and uncommented in the binaryString(line 		  456) and everywhere else byteLengthEncodedStringTerminated appears, or the 0x00 added to the definition of the string literal
	
	- the specification itself seems a little redundant and maybe should not be implemented exactly with the productions that are described there
		example: binary expression has an expansion "0x76 len8 String" and binary String has an expansion "len8 String"; this seems a little 			redundant at best, or we can have words such as "[..]0x76 len8 len8 String[..]" which would be correct according to the grammar but I don't 			know if they make sense
		 
binary word:
	- apparently this doesn't work either but I also cannot find any bugs in the grammar specification so I don't know why(TestMessage15.txt is an 		  ilustrative example)
