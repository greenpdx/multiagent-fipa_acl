NOTE
This directory structure follows some simple rules, to allow for generic build
processes and simplify reuse of this project. 

For build automation the project structure should be parsed and validated


STRUCTURE
-- src/ 
	Contains all header (*.h/*.hpp) and source files
-- build/
	The target directory for the build process, temporary content
-- resources/
	General resources such as images that are needed by the program
-- etc/
	Configuration files for running the program
-- external/
	When including software that needs a non standard installation process, or one that can be
	easily embedded include the external software directly here
   |-- include
	header files
   |-- libs
	precompiled libraries 
-- doc/
	should contain the existing doxygen file: doxygen.conf
   |-- manual/
	Should contain manual.tex 
	Manual for the software 	

CURRENT FUNCTIONALITY NOTES:
What it currently does:
	- allows building a State Machine manually and/or dynamically from a specification file
	- checks whether a certain flow of messages is valid with respect to the specified state machine
	- allows many to many relations
	- it is designed so that each agent has its perspective of the conversation(done at runtime when roles are mapped to actual AgentIDs)

What it currently does NOT do:
	- it does not implement/check any time constraints at runtime(in the flow of messages); these are most likely to be implemented on an upper level
	(i.e: when integrating it onto an "agent" platform)
